This project has adopted the Contributor Covenant as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it.

## Open Development

All work on its-i18n happens directly on GitHub. Both team members and contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process

## Versioning Policy

its-i18n follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes.
When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

Every significant change is documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.
